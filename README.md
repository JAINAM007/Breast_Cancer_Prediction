# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Here we have breast cancer data set. 
Data set Link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
In the repository for datasets take data.csv.
In the data set, we have 569 rows and 32 columns.
The predictive feature diagnosis column has 'M' that indicates malignant and 'B' that indicates benign.

We are predicting diagnosis through algorithms.
Here I have taken 2 Models for prediction.
